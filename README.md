# go2music
A DNLA/UPNP music-oriented application that drives DNLA music renderer with local audio files.

The genesis of this project is my AudioLabs 6000N streamer.  It has excellent audio quality.  Unfortunately,
its user interface is poor.  The interface with a PC holding all my ripped CDs of my personal collections is 
bad.  I tested my DNLA/UPNP servers.

Thus, I decided to write my own application.

It has been tested under Windows 11 and AudioLabs 6000N and Audiophile UPNP renderer.  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/audiophilerenderer/)
